# 🚗 SmartPark India — EV Smart Parking System

### 🧠 AI-Powered | ⚡ IoT-Inspired | 🅿️ Smart Parking Management for the Future

SmartPark India is a **real-time smart parking management system** designed to make EV and general parking more efficient, automated, and intelligent.
It simulates IoT sensors, manages EV battery levels, handles queues, predicts parking occupancy using Machine Learning, and offers chatbot + voice assistant support — all in one interactive web dashboard.

---

## 🌟 Features

✅ **Real-Time Parking Simulation**

* Automatically detects occupied and free slots using virtual sensors
* Animations and alerts for each parking event

✅ **EV Battery Monitoring**

* Tracks vehicle battery levels
* Shows alerts when battery < 20%

✅ **Queue Management System**

* Allows users to join a waiting queue
* Automatically assigns the next free slot

✅ **AI-Based Prediction (TensorFlow.js)**

* Predicts future parking occupancy trends using linear regression

✅ **Interactive Chatbot & Voice Assistant**

* Responds to voice or text queries about slots, queues, or EV info

✅ **Local Query Storage**

* Users can submit contact queries (stored safely in localStorage)

✅ **Responsive UI**

* Clean dark-themed interface
* Works smoothly across desktop and mobile

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. Each slot is represented as a colored tile:

   * 🟩 Green → Free
   * 🟥 Red → Occupied
   * 🟦 Blue → Reserved

2. A built-in simulator randomly marks slots as occupied/free to mimic IoT sensors.

3. EV battery levels drop randomly — a pop-up alert appears when low.

4. Users can join the waiting queue; when a slot frees up, the system automatically assigns it.

5. The AI model (trained in real-time) predicts the next occupancy percentage.

6. Users can chat or speak directly to the voice assistant for updates.

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/smartpark-india.git
   ```

2. **Open the project**

   ```bash
   cd smartpark-india
   ```

3. **Run locally**

   * Open `index.html` in your browser.
   * No server required — it’s a fully client-side simulation!
